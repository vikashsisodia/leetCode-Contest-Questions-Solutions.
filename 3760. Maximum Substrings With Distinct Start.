Example 1:
Input: s = "abab"
Output: 2
Explanation:
Split "abab" into "a" and "bab".
Each substring starts with a distinct character i.e 'a' and 'b'. Thus, the answer is 2.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcd"
Output: 4
Explanation:
Split "abcd" into "a", "b", "c", and "d".
Each substring starts with a distinct character. Thus, the answer is 4.

Code--
class Solution {
    public int maxDistinct(String s) {
        HashSet<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        int counter = 0;
        for(char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if(!set.contains(ch)) {counter++;}
            set.add(ch);
        }
        return counter;
    }
}
